## Hello!
My name is Christo, and I'm a Software Test Engineer located in Innsbruck, Austria.
Professionally, I focus on testing, test architecture, and anything related to automation.
In my spare time, I like to work on open source projects, familiarize myself with interesting technologies and improve my knowledge about software testing.

## Current long-term projects
- Learning and trying to master Go.
- Modernization by containerization.
